# DTMF Adder

A simple example of how to use DTMF with cartesia's SDK, by way of a story teller that a user can both talk to and also hear DTMF tones.

The storyteller will offer choices and confirm those choices with the user (both verbally and also sending the tone back to the user).

Example dialogue:

```
Agent: Hello! Press any button on the keypad or say 'start story'."
User: <says 'start story'>

Agent: You are Sir Reginald, a knight, at the annual royal banquet. Suddenly, the lights go out! Press 1 to draw your sword, or press 2 to shout, "What's happening?!
User: <presses 2>

Agent: <dialtone for 2>. You pressed 2. Panic erupts. You hear a struggle, then a chilling roar! Press 3 to cast a light spell, or press 4 to investigate the roar."
User: <says what kind of light spell?>

Agent: It is light spell, level 4 best used to fight demons. Press 3 to cast a light spell, or press 4 to investigate the roar.
User: <press 4>

Agent: <dial tone for 4> You pressed 4. Sorry, that is not a valid choice. Press 3 to cast a light spell, or press 4 to investigate the roar.
User: <press 3>

Agent: <diatone for 3> You pressed 3. As you investigate a roar, you see a shadow emerge from behind the table. Press #-9 to capture it in your amulet or press 1-2-3 to run away.
User: ...
```

Note: sometimes, gemini is not smart enough to continue the story when you give multiple button presses - so you might have to reprompt it to continue the story.
